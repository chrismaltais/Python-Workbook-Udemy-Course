## Lessons Learned

**ranges.py**: Array is useful for memory efficiency when everything you need in the list has a fixed type, but it isn't usually faster than using a list.

**simple_dictionary**: A `dict` function is another way to create a dictionary. `dict` is also used to convert other objects to a dictionary.

**key_error**: A `KeyError` always means Python could not find a key with the name shown next to `KeyError`

**add_dictionary_key**: You cannot fix the order of the dictionary items. Dictionaries are unordered collections of items.
